# Voice Chat Bot for Personalized Product Recommendations

Welcome to the README for our Voice Chat Bot project that aims to provide users with personalized product recommendations through interactive voice interactions. This chat bot is developed using React, Vue, TypeScript for the front-end, and Python, JSON, OpenAPI, and FastAPI for the backend.

## Overview

Our Voice Chat Bot is designed to enhance the user's shopping experience by offering them tailored product suggestions based on their preferences. By leveraging voice interactions, users can easily engage with the bot, making the recommendation process more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction:** Users can initiate conversations with the bot using voice commands, enabling a natural and conversational shopping experience.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The chat bot employs advanced algorithms to analyze user preferences, historical behavior, and real-time interactions to suggest products that match their interests.

- **Front-end Frameworks:** The user interface is developed using both React and Vue frameworks, ensuring flexibility and catering to a wider range of user preferences.

- **Back-end Technologies:** The back end is powered by Python and FastAPI, which enable efficient handling of voice input, data processing, and product recommendation generation.

- **Data Storage:** JSON is used to store and manage user profiles, preferences, and product data, allowing for easy retrieval and updates.

- **OpenAPI Specification:** Our API is documented using the OpenAPI specification, providing clear insights into endpoints, request/response structures, and data formats.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions in the README to set up the React and Vue front-end applications.

3. Move to the `backend` directory and set up the Python virtual environment by running:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Start the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

7. Access the bot through your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Recognition Accuracy:** Enhance voice recognition capabilities for more accurate and seamless interactions.

- **Integration with E-commerce Platform:** Integrate the chat bot with an e-commerce platform's database to fetch real-time product data and availability.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy over time based on user feedback.

- **User Profiles:** Develop a user profile system that enables users to save preferences and view personalized recommendations across devices.
